    <h2 align="center">Kalpa</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>Located on the Shimla-Kaza highway, the riverside town of Kalpa in Kinnaur district can be easily called a surprise destination. Situated on the banks of the Sutlej river, Kalpa seems to almost appear out of nowhere as it is well hidden behind a steep road, away from the direct view from the highway.Kalpa is where the pretty apple orchards are aplenty. When I say that, I mean there are apples growing everywhere! Not just a farm or two, but it has several kilometres long stretch of apples. And don’t think it’s just apple trees here, wait till you see the Kinner Kailash and Raldang Kailash views from Kalpa. It will instantaneously steal your heart.
        Himachal as one of the top tourist destinations in India shouldn’t come as a surprise. It’s a tourist destination all year round, and some of the major tourist hotspots like Shimla Manali, Kullu can quickly get overcrowded. But not Kalpa.</p>
