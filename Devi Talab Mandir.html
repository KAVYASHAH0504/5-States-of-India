    <h2 align="center">Devi Talab Mandir</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>The famous Devi Talab Temple is situated in the heart of Jalandhar city, just 1 km from the railway station.
         It is believed to be more than 200 years old. The temple is dedicated to Goddess Durga and is one of the 51 Shakthi pithas in India.
          The image of Lord Shiva that is enshrined herein is called Bhisan Bhairav. Devi Talab Temple has been renovated recently and a number of changes have been made to the old structure.
           Also, a new temple has been constructed within the temple premises. Even a model of Amarnath Yatra was constructed sometime back only.The gods afraid that the Lord’s anger would destroy the universe sought the assistance of Lord Vishnu who dispatched his all-powerful discus – Sudarshan Chakra – to cut Sati’s body into pieces. 
            Every spot that received a portion of Maa Sati’s body became in the ages that followed a place of worship for devotees of the Goddess. Each of these spots is honoured as a Shakti Peetha by devotees of the Goddess who are also referred to as Shaktas. The Devi Talab Mandir has the distinction of being one of the 51 prominent Shakti Peethas on the subcontinent.
         The temple marks the spot that was blessed with Maa Sati’s right breast. </p>
