    <p>As one traverses the length and breadth of Gujarat, one constantly stumbles across architectural legacies of the 'Solanki' rule. You keep coming across living spaces and monuments of another time, offering an eclectic glimpse of the artistic and ingenious beauty that makes this exotically state vibrant.

        A soothing drive amidst green farmlands almost 25 km away from Mehsana on the way to the temples of goddess Bahucharaji reposes the village of Modhera. Set along the backdrop of River Pushpavati, surrounded by a terra-formed garden of flowering trees and songs of birds, rests the famed Sun temple of Modhera.
        
        The remains of the Sun Temples at Modhera dedicated to sun god are relics of times gone by when reverence of the natural elements fire, air, earth, water and sky were at their peak sharing space with myriad manifestations of Vedic gods. The ancient philosophy venerating natural elements and its association with humans was considered the prime force and energy of the life cycle. A walk around the serene temple campus makes you aware of the positively strong aura of energy which the place radiates and through it brings one closer to the environs.
        
        Adding the beauty in this already famous popular Modhera Sun Temple. In October, 2022 Honorable Prime Minister Shri Narendrabhai Modi Inaugurated Solar powered 3-D Projection Mapping Show and Heritage Lighting at the Temple. Which is one of a kind experience. It has added another feather in the cap of this already well known temple.</p>
