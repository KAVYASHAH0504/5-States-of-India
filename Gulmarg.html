    <hr>
    <p>Gulmarg literally means “Meadow of flowers”.
         Gulmarg is located 60 KMs away from Srinagar which is an hour and half journey by car.
          Gulmarg has attracted millions of tourists throughout its existence with the scenic beauty of the Himalayan Mountains in the back drop.
           One of the main attractions in Gulmarg is the Gulmarg Gondola, the Highest Cable Car in the world. 
           The 1st phase of the Gondola takes tourists to the height of 8530 ft to Kongdori Station and the second stage of the Gondola goes up to the height of 12293 ft. 
           Tourists can enjoy horse Riding and can go riding to the magnificent “Strawberry Valley” , Leopards Valley and ride up to “Kongdori” to see the frozen lake of “Al- Pathar”.
            Gulmarg in winter is a magnificent experience, fully covered in a white blanket of Snow which turns it into a skiers paradise.
         The natural slopes here are untouched and prove to be a challenge to ace skiers! Besides the scenic side to Gulmarg, winter time in Gulmarg is a season of festivities with celebrations of “White Christmas” and New Year parties. </p>
