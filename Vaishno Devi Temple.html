    <h2 align="center">Vaishno Devi Temple</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>Vaishno Devi Temple is one of the oldest temples in India. It has a rich history which is still unknown to a lot of people. It is not possible to ascertain everything that has happened but, there are certain things that we know about and are eager to share.

        A study says that the Vaishno Devi Temple is millions of years old. There was no mention of truth that a female deity was worshiped. The acknowledgment of worshiping Shakti was started, in the Puranic period, at the time of Mahabharata. Before the famous war of Kurushetra between Kauravas and Pandavas, Shri Krishna advised Arjun to take blessings of Mother Goddess for victory. A good amount of people believed that Pandavas were the first to build the temples at Bhawan and Kandoli for showing gratitude for Mother Goddess.
        
        It is also believed that there were five stone structures of Pandavas built adjacent to Trikuta mountain in the holy cave. The historical visit to the Vaishno Devi Temple is of Guru Gobind Singh and was said to be there in the Holy cave who have gone there via Purmandal.</p>
