It is one of a kind and is also the sixth largest bridge in the whole world. It is 2150 feet in length with a suspending span that right above the Hooghly River. The bridge was commissioned in 1943 and was initially called as the New Howrah Bridge since it had replaced the pontoon bridge. It links two cities- both Kolkata and Howrah. In 1965, it was given another name called Rabindra Setu and this name was kept in honor of the renowned Bengali poet Rabindranath Tagore. But today it is popularly known as the Howrah Bridge.

        The Howrah Bridge is a significant landmark of Kolkata. There are a total of four bridges namely- Vidysagar Setu bridge, Vivekananda Setu and the Nivedita Setu bridge that was built recently. It is said that the bridge carries traffic of 100,000 vehicles and 150,000 pedestrians. When this bridge was first constructed is was the third longest cantilever bridge and now it stands in the sixth position.
        
        It serves as an ideal gateway to Kolkata and connects it to the famous Howrah station. In 1946, in a census carried out, it said that the bridge saw a daily traffic of 27400 vehicles and 12100 pedestrians. In fact ages ago the bridge had also carried trams that left from Howrah station terminus. However, it seemed like the bridge could not take the weight of the heavy weight and hence running trams on the bridge was discontinued. Currently, the bridge can bear the weight of 60,000 vehicles only but it still carried almost 90000 vehicles daily. The bridge also has a separate foot path for pedestrians to walk.</p>
