    <h2 align="center">Belur Math</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>Belur Math is the headquarters of Ramakrishna Math and the Ramakrishna Mission, founded by Swami Vivekananda, the chief disciple of Ramakrishna Paramahamsa. It is located on the west bank of the Hooghly River in India, at Belur , and is one of the notable institutions in Kolkata. The temple is the heart of the Ramakrishna movement. It is notable for its architecture, which symbolizes the unity of all religions, Hindu, Islamic, Buddhist, and Christian. In 2003, the Belur Math Railway Station was also inaugurated which is dedicated to the Belur Math Temple.
        Ramakrishna Math and Ramakrishna Mission are worldwide, non-political, non-sectarian spiritual organizations which have been engaged in various forms of humanitarian, social service activities for more than a century. Inspired by the ideals of renunciation and service, the monks and lay devotees of the Math and Mission serve millions of men, women and children, without any distinction of caste, religion or race, because they see the living God in them.
        
        The organizations were brought into existence by Sri Ramakrishna (1836-1886), the great 19th-century saint from Bengal who is regarded as the Prophet of the Modern Age, and Sri Ramakrishna’s chief disciple, Swami Vivekananda (1863-1902), one of the foremost thinkers and religious leaders of the present age, who is regarded as ‘one of the main moulders of the modern world ‘, in the words of an eminent Western scholar A.L. Basham.
        
        Although Ramakrishna Math and Ramakrishna Mission are legally and financially separate, they are closely interrelated in several ways and are regarded as twin organizations.
        
        These twin organizations have set in motion a non-sectarian, universal spiritual movement which has been silently working for more than a hundred years to catalyze the spiritual regeneration of humanity.</p>
